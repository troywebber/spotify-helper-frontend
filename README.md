# Spotify Web Player Clone

A Spotify inspired interface complete with playlist, album, artist, liked songs and library pages.

## Description

This is my most recent project, currently working on replicating the Spotify web player app using their API. This project is using Next.js for the front-end, deployed on Netlify, and uses node.js for the back-end, which handles the user authentication, this is deployed with Heroku.
